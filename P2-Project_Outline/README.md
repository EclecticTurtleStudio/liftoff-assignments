# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A web based app that allows Dungeon Masters and Game Masters to randomly
generate worlds and other more miniscule details for their campaigns! This
will free up their creative energy to coming up with stories for why things
are happening in their worlds. This is useful for both homebrew games, and
for filler information for character backstories and such for longer module
campaigns.
Through a couple of button clicks, users will be able to generate as many
details about the world as they would like. They alternatively can edit the
results, lock in their own ideas, and/or save it to their own story boards.
I would like to make it so users can submit new ideas to be included with
the generated results as well.Include overview here
### Features
User Accounts - Each user will be able to login to the app, where they will
have their own library.
Feature Generator - Users will be able to generate many different features
of locations for their games. They can also add in their own features;
choose to generate one, many or all; and lock features into place before
regenerating (think Yatzee).
Libraries (actual name pending) - Users will be able to store their story
elements in their own personal library. They will be able to add, edit,
and/or delete their story elements.
### Technologies
Java, HTML(Spring?), CSS(Bootstrap?), MySQL
I feel like I will be using more than this, maybe some JavaScript
somewhere, but this is a start!
### What I'll Have to Learn
~ While we dabbled in the idea of User Accounts, I will need to learn how
to have each of them have their own saved data. I think that will be my
biggest obstacle.
~ Also, if I decide to make this a live application, I will need to
research having a non local server, and how to connect and work with it!
